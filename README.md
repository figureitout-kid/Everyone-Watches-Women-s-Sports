# Everyone-Watches-Womens-Sports
Web Scraper user interface to show where, when, and how a user can watch a women's sporting event at any given day or time. 

This is my new baby. A project fueled by a problem I see as a women's sports fan- you really have to search around to find when a game is and what network is streaming the game. This project will hopefully solve that issue of over complicating and make it easier for fans to tune in seemlessly. 

As of 03/04/24-- this is now in the design stages. I know nothing about web scraping, but am currently brain storming on what the end result could look like for users. 

- To show all events that day? 
- To give users the option to select a sport/league? And show upcoming games?
- To allow users to subscribe/follow certain teams/sports. 
- Would it be possible to link to the streaming service? Are there copy right rules regarding that. 
- What exciting APIs exist out in the world to utilize?


Stay Tuned.
